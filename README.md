# battleships-go-tdd

Starter code for slides "If you build it, you must test it - TDD"

We will add to this during the session

## Exercise 1 - Place a ship on the Sea

- Find `TestSeaNotEmpty` in `battleships_test.go`
- Design how to put a ship on the Sea (hint: a [method](https://gobyexample.com/methods) is a good choice)
- Fill in the Act section
- Implement the code

Run all tests using

```bash
go test ./...
```

Make sure your new test passes - and the existing test still passes.
